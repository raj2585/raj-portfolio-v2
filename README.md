# Raj Khedkar – Portfolio v2

Welcome to the second version of my personal portfolio website.  
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site showcases my projects, experience, and interests in a clean, minimal layout—drawing inspiration from both Japanese aesthetics and Brittany Chiang's portfolio design.
